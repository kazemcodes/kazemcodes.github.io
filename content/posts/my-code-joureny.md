Hello,
This is my first post on this site, for a long time, I wanted to write something on web but
I didn't had enough time until today.

[IReader](https://github.com/IReaderorg/IReader) was my first app that I created, the first time I had thought of creating
something that could scrape data from a website was near 8 month ago. at that time, I had no idea how to add extensions
to the app, I only wanted to just scrape a single website that I always used, from the beginning I made this project,
I just want to create an app that could make reading easier and decrease the amount of time, I spend finding novels. I 
didn't use any other app at that time, and I thank god for that, because if I used other apps, I probably wouldn't create
IReader.

Recently, I made a breakthrough in extension stuff from an idea that comes from a project called [CloudStream](https://github.com/recloudstream/cloudstream)
which could stream movies and series from web, the only difference from tachi was that unlike tachi it can install extensions 
without users confirmation and the extension size is a lot less than before.
