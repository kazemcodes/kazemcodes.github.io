Hi, again

In this post I'm going to write about my future plan for IReader, when I created IReader for the first time, I had a dream to port IReader to everyone platform,but at that time there wasn't enough libraries to support this dream.

But as the time passed, finally At the time that I'm writing this post, I'm almost done In Supporting Multiplatform.

The biggest obstacles currently is in supporting extensions like IReader do in android.
Because ClassLoaders are a bit different in android and desktop, I have idea how to load class in desktop, but it's still needs more experiment to achieve perfection.
